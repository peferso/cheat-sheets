# Introduction
Several cheat-sheets of different topics in .md format.

I found this framework very useful to quickly gather simple and handy notes and resources about commands, proceedures, configurations... related to several software/frameworks that I have faced in my daily work. The purpose of this documentation is twofold:
* Save some time to myself redoing google search queries to find out the answer to some difficulties
* Perhaps serve you as a pleasant introduction or first step to some of the topics, since for many of them I have created this notes during my first learning iterations and crashes. 

If you are watching this content in Github: 
* There is one folder per topic.
* Navigate into each of the different folders of this project to access the README.md files containing the cheat sheets.

This content is also on Github pages (presented with a fancy default theme), I invite you to navigate this content [here](https://peferso.github.io/cheat-sheets/)

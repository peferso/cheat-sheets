# Introduction

Did you ever have to struggle to painfully remember how to use the find command in ubuntu or some other linux command line hack?
Do you know by memory the git command to override an outdated local repository with the github updated version?

Certainly I don't... And in order to save myself some time doing google searches I have collected here several cheat-sheets of different topics in .md format.

I find the GitHub Pages service combined with markdown syntax very useful to quickly gather simple, handy notes, as well as resources about commands, proceedures, configurations... related to several software/frameworks that I have faced in my daily work. The purpose of this documentation is twofold:
* Save some time to myself redoing google search queries to find out the answer to some difficulties
* Perhaps serve you as a pleasant introduction or first step to some of the topics, since for many of them I have created this notes during my first learning iterations and crashes. 

If you are watching this content in Github: 
* There is one folder per topic.
* Navigate into each of the different folders of this project to access the README.md files containing the cheat sheets.

This content is also on Github pages (presented with a fancy default theme), I invite you to navigate this content [here](https://peferso.github.io/cheat-sheets/)
